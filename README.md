#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is an engineering field that applies engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems and it involves software product design, development, testing , deployment and maintenance.
Importance - Creation of software application and systems

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Development of Programming languages 
2.The birth of software engineering 
3.Rise of Agile methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements - the process of identifying user needs and requirements.
2. Design - the developmemt of well established designs  of software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation - writing code and building the software
4. Testing- conducting various test to ensure the software meets quality statndards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment - the process of making the softare available for use
6. Maintenance - providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements of the software  

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall applies sequential approach with distinct phases and a section has to be completed fully before the next phase can begin while Agile technology is iterative and incremental approach that is focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change and enhances customer feedback.
Watrefall is documentation focused while Agile is mostly collaborative.
Examples - Waterfall - Medical device software
         -Agile - StartUp Product development

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer - Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
2. Quality assuarance -  ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
3. Project Manager - oversee the planning, execution and delivery of software products

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated Development enviroments - it provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code. 
Example - Visual Studio
Version Control Systems - they are software tools that track changes to source code and cordinating work among team members 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.Changing requirements- during the developmemt cycle there may be changes leading to project delays
2.Tight deadlines - pressure to deliver software products on scheduled timelines resulting into compromised quality
Strategies - Effective communication 
           - Agile methodologies
           - Prioritization of tasks

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing - testing individual components and units of code parts to ensure it works properly
Intergration - it tests on the interaction between different modules to ensure they work together 
System - evaluates the intergrated software system to ensure it meets specified requirements.
Acceptance - perfomed to assess whether the software meets the business requirements and is ready for deployment

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is a field of engineering that majors in the crafting of questions and statements to get the best possible responses from AI models
Importance - it helps in extracting relevant information that enables a user to the context and intent of a request.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague - Tell me about technology
Clear- summarize the gradual growth of software technology stating the indivduals who pioneered its growth and the imporovemts they brought
